# etcars-python-client
This simple code can help you with receiving data from etcars and then use that data however you'd like to using Python.

Feel free to use this as you want.

# Notes
1. Use port 30001 and localhost for receiving data
2. There's an issue with validating the JSON, I am working on fixing that issue
3. This project is not maintained by the creators of etcars.
4. I do not recommend setting the update time below 2 seconds, because it causes stability and performance issues with the game (aka. freezes it - it might be just my PC, so if it works for you flawlessly, please notify me on the issues tab)
